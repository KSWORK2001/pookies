          Hey Butterball! Wow, can you believe we're already at our two-month mark? It's crazy how time flies when you're having such an amazing time with someone as weird as you. I look back at all the moments we've shared and realize just how lucky I am to have you in my life.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          This past month has been a rollercoaster of emotions and experiences. From our ✨Talk✨ to getting to know each other on a deeper level, every moment has been a beautiful journey. Even though we had our first disagreement, I'm grateful for it because it showed me how strong and resilient our relationship is. I'm still sorry about that, but it taught us how to understand and support each other even more.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Our friends are starting to know about us, and it's wonderful to see how excited they are for us. I'm proud to be with someone as amazing as you and thrilled to share our happiness with the people who matter most to us.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          And let's not forget about your internship! I'm so proud of you for pushing through it and coming out stronger on the other side. It's inspiring to see your dedication and passion in everything you do, and I'm glad you're no longer being drained every day. Your success is a testament to your brilliance and talent, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
          Throughout all the ups and downs (Wait Whaaaaa), the laughter and the challenges, your continuous support has been a rock for me. You are my partner, my confidant, and my best friend. I cherish every moment with you and am excited for the countless adventures and memories we'll create together.          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Here's to us, to our love, and to the many more months and years of happiness ahead. I love you more than words can express, and I'm grateful every day for the blessing of having you in my life. Here's to always and foreevr!          </p>
